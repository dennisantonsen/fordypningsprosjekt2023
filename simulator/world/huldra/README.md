# Huldra models


The `sdf` files were used as golden source and converted to `gltf` (game engine) and `pgm` (robot navigation) files.  
`gltf` has one extra file named `huldra-smaller-vents.gltf`. This is model is based on `sdf/huldra-smaller` and contains just the vents as this makes it easy to pick them out in the game engine.
